# react-bootcamp
A repository containing the my copies of assignments/challenges/files for Tyler McGiniss's online React Bootcamp. This bootcamp was held as a free promotion for TylerMcGiniss.com and can be found on YouTube [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8GXXGJRDMdQ&list=PLqrUy7kON1mfWjiu0GWQhefWSx38v0UGo).

__Note__: Though the index.html file is marked by GitHub as an HTML file, the main part of the file is a script tag with an in-browser Babel Transpiler which renders the React it contains.
